To compile with CREST (although really we should merge all of this
code into a single file):

LIBS='-lcrest -lyices -lstdc++' \
LDFLAGS='-L../../lib -L/Users/jburnim/yices-1.0.14/lib' \
CFLAGS='-I../../include -g' ./configure --enable-shared=no

make CC='../../cil/bin/cilly --save-temps --doCrestInstrument --noPrintLn'

(And: Always "make clean" before re-building.)
